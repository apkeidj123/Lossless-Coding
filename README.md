# Lossless-Coding
Comparison of different compression mechanisms

Codes implementing different data compression methods , including Huffman coding, Adaptive Huffman coding, Arithmetic coding, LZ77 and
LZ78. Compare varying sources, including two gray level images, binary images, halftone images. The y are 256 x 256 images and each sample is of 1 byte long.

* Input filename: lena.raw (for example)
* Output filename: lena .huf (for example)
* Choose one compression method:
1) Huffman coding
2) Adaptive Huffman coding
3) Arithmetic coding
